We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends , in order to be done quicker .\n","I 've taken a lot of spin classes over the years , and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle . From the nice , clean space and amazing bikes , to the welcoming and motivating instructors , every class is a top notch work out . For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in , the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead ( and there 's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do ) . There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell , the owner of Body Cycle , a shout out . Russell 's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident , as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed . He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement , and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone . Russell always wears a smile on his face , even when he 's kicking your butt in class !\n","\n","[34867, 15549, 24350, 18925, 10107, 59751, 33931, 19867, 56586, 13159, 48579, 20590, 62822, 18925,
