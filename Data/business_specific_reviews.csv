For $10 or $12 you should get fries with your burger, not a large to share for $8.  I had a bison burger. that was the only reason I went there.  Seems we had 1 beer, 1 iced tea, 1 burger, 1 bison burger and split a large fry, for about $37.  Rather ridiculous. And they try to hard to be different or interesting, but ruin a good meal.  The bison burger was tainted with unnecessary slaw and BBQ on it to call it a Carolina bison burger.  Not worth $12 on its own.

Been there.  Done that.  No reason to go back.  Next...",2015-11-06 02:27:35

The burgers are incredible and the boozy shakes are like no other. The first time I had horchata shake I honestly had dreams about it for like a week. It's also super centrally located, a quick walk from Wash Ave and other downtown attractions. Great vibe, although I always prefer to get a table upstairs than sit at the community tables on the ground floor.

The burger selection is really, really great. You can pretty much get whatever your heart desires. I've had mac n cheese patties on my burger, you can get a bison burger, turkey burger, literally anything. I have tried a ton and have never been let down by the flavor combinations. The waiters are always super honest, in a good way. If you ask them what's better, X or Y, they're not going to jerk you around and say they're equally good. They'll give you their honest opinion. LOVE that. 

Another unique aspect about Bailey's Range is that they have a burger showdown (can't remember their technical term for it) where last week's featured burger goes up against a new burger recipe. It's a cool call-out that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. 

The only reason I gave it a 4/5 star instead of 5/5 is because I've had a couple of instances (out of MANY visits, so it's really not alarming or anything) where I requested my burger medium or medium-rare and it turned out a little well done. I still ate it, but it wasn't really what I expected.",2016-06-22 21:47:29

My wife and I had the ABC burger and the lamb burger and shared halves...this was a flavor explosionary experience! Everything about both burgers was awesome! The meat was delish, the buns perfect, toppings perfect.

The beer selection is all St. Louis area beer except no AB-InBev products which isnt St. Louis area beer anymore is it? The pickle was like the best pickle I've ever had and the ketchup was great too.  They actually make the pickles and ketchup themselves.  Fries were quite good, kindof a British-style chip, you  know a little translucent.  For soda lovers, they have an amazing array of non corn-syrup selections, i.e., cane sugar.

Extra points for the homemade buns (gluten free and vegan options), and creative choices. The fries were good. And the side salad was tasty too.

All the choices make it kind of hard to choose. I'd like to see them pare down the menu a bit, focus on 5-10 burgers that they can really do well. Some of the choices are so similar too that I don't think it'd be hard to edit  a bit.

Everyone was raving about the soda choice but no Cheerwine? WTF? Maybe Cheerwine really doesn't exist outside of the Carolinas. There was a ""Carolina"" burger on the menu (suspicious that this would really be Carolina style i.e. w/ pulled pork, vinegar sauce, and slaw on the burger, but we'll have to see) but no Cheerwine? That just doesn't seem right.

The ice cream was also delicious. I got a salted caramel shake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Every bit of it was delicious, especially the chocolate sauce. Next time might need to get a sundae just for more of that sauce.

Food:  

Me - LGBT Burger - Goat cheese, bacon. 

My son - Daves Smoked - Cold smoked patty, fontina cheese caramelized onions

the BF - Ozark - mushrooms, black peppered goat cheese caramelized onions

My son's friend - The Basic - basic burger - +$1 for cheese

All of the burgers were EXCELLENT.  I can only speak for myself, so first of all, all of our food came out HOT, the buns are made in-house and were delicious.  super tasty, nicely toasted and crispy yet soft - i wanted to take some home with me.  The combination of the goat cheese and bacon with the burger was perfect.  I loved it.  It did not need anything else.  I did put some of the chipotle sauce that came with our fries (separate purchase) and it was pretty good, but not necessary.  Burgers were a pretty good size - they were smaller than the bun, but still a good size.  Worth the price?  Sure, this was a quality burger!  My only gripe, however is that the price did not include fries (see below).

No one left a morsel on their plates.  My son's friend ate so fast we actually thought he was a little strange...no one should eat that fast...

Sides:  We ordered two large french fries ($4 each) to share between four people and it was exactly enough.  You have a choice of ""sauces.""   I was not impressed at all - they were just fries, and honestly with burgers starting at about $8 these fries should come with the burgers.  I need to have french fries with my burger, so I will pay every time, but suggest that they re-think this item and make them worth the price and at least make something worth the price like  garlic fries.  These are NOT worth the extra $2-$4.

We also had the Cheese Curds - ok not what I was expecting but it was good.  Not sure what kind of cheese it was but it went really well with the mustard and apples - the bread/crackers however were a nightmare almost funny - they crumbled because they were so thin!  Almost like lace.  They really should be a little thicker.  Again, it was good, but c'mon please be a little more generous with the thickness of the bread/cracker.  

The boys had ice cream, but I won't comment because I did not taste it.  I was too full from the burger.  Hope to on the next trip.  

Overall, we had a great time.  Service was stellar, the place itself is very cute, but I can see how it may be a little awkward if it's packed, especially sitting at the communal table.

The server was very friendly, prompt, and attentive.  
The food tasted fantastic, and was cooked just as we ordered it.
The two reasons I didn't give five stars:  
First - The burgers were a little smallish for their price.  If I'm paying $10 for a burger, I want something substantial, and I found the amount of meat a little lacking.
Second - While I realize that there are only so many cooks for so many people (cause the place was pretty crowded), it did take like 45 minutes for our burgers to be ready; and, while I understand that these are gourmet burgers with all sorts of special  ingredients... bottom line is I think that the amount of time it takes meat to cook is sort of universal, and burgers should be a little quicker than that.",2013-08-04 13:28:39

One, the place is adorable. Upon first glance, one might note that it is reminiscent of an old industrial factory, but more like a factory that a group of rag-tag children made into a playhouse. Vibrant color, flowers, natural lights fun stair cases, decorative window panes... Really fun environment. 

Service was a little slow, but considering they were packed to the brim because of our conference I let it slide. Waitress and hostess were really friendly. 

This place has delicious and fresh burgers that come in such unique flavor combinations. I came back a second time just to try another one. First one I had was the Hog-Thai'ed which was a peanut glazed burger served with Thai rice noodles. SOOOOOO GOOOD. The one I had the next day was the American. (If you're worried about your cardiovascular health, please don't eat this one.) it is your classic bacon burger topped with melted cheese and fried Mac-n-cheese. Let's just say it changed me. Fries are amazing and paired perfectly with their unique sauces. Loved the sriracha mayo. A must try. 

They also serve a million types of sodas including draft sodas, shakes (loved the cinnamon shake) as well as boozy shakes which are as wonderful wd they sound.

Ice cream was average nothing special. The only saving grace of this experience was our waitress Alexandra who was super attentive and friendly. If it wasn't for her I would give this place 1 star, but because of her I would give this place another chance if I'm ever back in the area again.

I hope this goes beyond management to reach the attention of the ownership. I'll preface by conveying that we did bring most of our concerns to the attention of management and were somewhat compensated. That's the only reason this isn't a 2 star review.

At 2:00-ish on Saturday afternoon with about 40% table occupancy, it was about 10-15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server who got our drink order (just 2 soft drinks.) About 5-10 minutes later she came back and said she didn't pickup our drinks yet but could take our food order (!!)

Only after we got our food and our table (including kids!) began commenting about the portion size did my wife remind me when we were here last I said I was glad my company was paying!!

I realized I'm getting a bit long winded so...
* Skip the 'gluten free' bun and go breadless, it's poor tasting and falls apart.
* the ""pretzels"" are balls of sweet dough that taste like they were previously frozen and defrosted
* the good news and bad news on the Caesar salad croutons were that they (good) seemed house-made (bad) were badly over-toasted.
* I thought the $5 fries we received were the $3 fries based on the quantity and the table consensus was they could have been a bit crispier/fresher.

The manager only took off the $1 gluten free bun upgrade and the ""pretzels."" He was apologetic and blamed it on being understaffed. 

It didn't seem to be a staffing issue but that everyone from host team to servers were just a bit too laid back about their jobs to help their guests the way a $20+ per guest restaurant should be.",2018-07-07 22:34:48

The good:
They have a community table dinner once a month where they have guest chefs come in and create a buffet (different each month).  It costs $20 all you care to eat and all proceeds go to a different organization each month.  Beautiful concept and beautifully executed.

They make their own gluten free bread.

They have the brilliant combo of bourbon, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  Mmmmm......good.

The not so good:
The gluten free bread leaves a lot to be desired.  Very dense, heavy and super crumbly.  I admire the desire to make things in house but there are way better gluten free bread makers in St. Louis that could provide them with buns.

The burger (ABC burger) was dry and way too overcooked for my taste.  

The price is waaaay too high in my opinion and I left there feeling nickel and dimed for every little thing.

I'm kind of a cheapo, so the pricey burgers were at first a turn off, but I had heard very good things about their specialty burgers from other friends. I helped myself to the basic burger, which I asked for cooked all the way, and was pleasantly not dry at all. You know what else was delightful? Their homemade ketchup!

The full-sized power salad was huge and tasty, kids' chicken strips were made from real white meat chicken (and were delicious), and the burgers were amazing. Fries and sides were creative. Service was prompt, friendly, and very welcome after a hot, exhausting day. Ice cream was home-made and creamy.

Being a burger aficionado, I was happy to indulge my girl's burger passion.  At the same time, we were excited because the Range makes everything from scratch -- and I mean everything, right down to homemade buns and homemade sauces.  If they made their own glassware, plates, and silverware, I think they would have taken the experience to a whole new level!  

We got there shortly after the Range opened, so seating was not a problem.  Our server took our drink orders.  She had a dark beer, and I had the ""Sweet Sweet Bacon"" -- a milkshake with Maker's Mark, candied bacon, and salted caramel ice cream.  The shake was good -- I think mine might have had a little too much Maker's Mark, knocking the balance of the drink off, but I didn't mind -- it had been a long week up to Thursday...!  We skipped appetizers and went right to mains.  She ordered the American burger, and was more than happy.  Then again, who wouldn't want a fried mac'n cheese patty atop their burger, which was cooked medium rare (appropriately the way she wanted it) on a soft bun (double score for her!).  I ordered the Ahh Jamn!, which was supposed to come with bacon jam, red onions (I had asked for caramelized onions), mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  When my burger came out, I was ready to kill it, so started enjoying it.  About midway through the experience, it dawned on me -- ""...is this my burger?""  I didn't really get the taste of bacon jam or mushrooms, though it looked like it might have been on there.  The cheese enveloped my burger, so it was hard to tell whether I had the right burger.  But I pressed on anyway, because I was hungry.  We also ordered a large order of fries, and asked for their house mayo and house cheese sauce.  The fries were great, and the homemade sauces were divine.

Overall, this was a good experience.  In hindsight, I should have said something to our server regarding my burger, but I chose not to.  That was my bad.  That's the only reason why I give Bailey's 4/5 stars rather than 5/5 stars.

The upstairs seating area was pretty sparsely populated on a Wednesday night, but there were some folks watching Game 1 in the bar downstairs - we knew about it because of the hoots when something good happened for the Cards. 

The drink menu was diverse and yet manageable. Quite often when I go to some restaurants in places like St. Louis or Denver, the drink menu seems to be competing for who can use the most trees to document the amount of alcohol they have available. For someone who is terrible at making choices, I hate those places, since there's just TOO much good stuff! Kudos, Bailey's Range, for helping those of us who are indecisive!

I ended up ordering a red wine to go with by burger - interesting choice, I know, but I was NOT feeling beer last night for whatever reason. I ordered the Smoked burger, which has caramelized onions and cheese and rooster sauce. It was awesome. The bun was soaking up all the delicious grease from the cheese and the meat, and the whole experience was just great.

We had an average wait time (about 30 mins on a Saturday night) which we thought was great. However, upon being seated we waited about 10 minutes before water was even brought to us. And then waited another 10-15 minutes before we were asked what we wanted to drink. We waited about another 10-15 minutes for our drinks (the limoncello is delicious and refreshing for summer). Our food came quickly (maybe 20 minutes after we ordered). It came hot and delicious, but we were missing sauces, out of water and our server was no where to be found. Maybe another 10 minutes after we had gotten our food we were finally provided with more water and out sauces. The food was very good, did not disappoint. After we were done, we waited with our plates for about another 10 minutes before our serve came. We then requested our checks, which is the first thing they brought promptly all night. We got our cards out, then waited another 10-15 minutes before she picked up our checks, which seemed odd to me because typically turn around once you get the check seems to be pretty quick in most restaurants. Perhaps the server was double sat, or new or something, which I could understand the slowness, but the server never apologized for us having to wait on her countless times.

Teen 2 insisted on onion rings and both girls wanted milk shakes.  Onion rings were giant, good and piping hot with yummy sauce.  They were absolutely dripping in grease though, and there was a large unappetizing pool of grease left on the plate.  Better on the plate than in my stomach, but maybe they could have served them on paper towels or something...

Both girls ordered brownie milkshakes.  They were delicious, but tiny.  I liked them so much I decided to order a peanut butter one for myself.  The lack of peanut butter flavor was a huge disappointment to me - I have this problem often as I like to be positively smacked in the face with peanut butter taste and many PB flavored things fall short of this.  The shakes were comically tiny for $3.50.

I had the american burger on a pretzel bun.  Meat, mac n cheese, cheddar sauce, and bacon on a pretzel roll.  I didn't love the mac n cheese they used, but the burger was pretty yummy and I couldn't finish it all.  

Fries were served cold on the first go-round.  The waitress took them back and replaced them with hot fries without question.  The hot fries were much better and the Teens loved the sauces.  We chose cheddar and rooster sauces.

Service was excellent; our waitress was very friendly and we didn't want for anything throughout the course of the meal.

It was more than that, it was great! I always wanted this place to be awesome, but every burger I ordered was under seasoned and bland. Not to mention the high price! You pay upwards of $10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you don't get a side with it. Now I'm willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch (which I believe theirs is) and when the flavor is amazing (which it hadn't been until yesterday). So, maybe it's time for me to give this place another try.

I have actually always been a fan of their fries, their house made sauces and their onion rings. 

Their ice cream was never really my favorite. I really prefer a creamier ice cream and I feel theirs is on the ice side. However, I think I've come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that it's just different. My favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream. I got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well!

Annoyances worth mentioning:

The service! I've always had servers with decent attitudes, but they've never been terribly attentive. I always feel like I'm looking around for them and waiting for them to come back. I don't know if they're understaffed??

The noise! This place is super echo-ey and super loud! It made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation. 

Parking. It's not easy or cheap.

Community seating. I've been at the community table two out of my three visits. Both times I was lucky enough not be sat right next to strangers. But it's still nit my favorite style of seating...

Over all, I know I'm going to go back to this place. Especially since I finally found a burger worth paying for.",2015-06-22 02:15:41

The restaurant has a decent atmosphere. The ceiling has old stuff hanging from it with a modern architectural flare.
Going upstairs I noticed the steps were caked in old compact dirt and grime, it reminded me of a set of dorm stairs. It's a pretty old building but they could have refinished it better.

The bathroom upstairs was in decent condition. But, they hadn't dusted in some time and there was quite a bit of dust caked on the water pipes and top of door frame etc.

We sat upstairs at a table overlooking the street. Decent view.

We started off the meal with a pitcher of their ""boozy"" lemonade for 30 something dollars. I can guarantee there wasn't much ""boozy"" in it. Tasted good but order something else if you want something with alcohol in it.

On to the food.

It took at least a half hour to get food for 6 people and when we ordered the place was less than half full.

The Burger meat had flavor but was dry. For $11 for the burger alone I would expect better.

The Chips and sauces were pretty good but small portions.

Overall a Meh experience. I won't go back and won't recommend the place to anyone else. 

In my opinion, they are trying to be an upscale hip burger joint with small portions with a high price tag but the flavor doesn't live up to the expectation.",2016-10-14 21:29:49

What do I mean about ""interesting""?

At least 16 different types of burgers...9 different types of sugar cane root beers, a huge alcohol menu, alcoholic floats, ice cream...they've got a lot of everything here!

Now, on to the review about the place itself:

1) Waitstaff - Back Story: Two of us in our party had our minds made up even though we were originally deciding between two different burgers.  It took the waiter about 3 seconds to get us to change our minds (due to the burger being his personal favorite).  Everyone we encountered was friendly and accommodating

2) Facility - This place is HUGE, with an upstairs and downstairs seating area, and it is definitely GREAT for large groups.  The environment was very casual yet not rowdy

3) Burgers - I decided to go with the ABC burger, which contained roasted apples, bacon and I gotta say it was definitely interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  My other coworkers decided to get the Morocco burger (spiced lamb, caramelized onion chutney, feta, arugula) and seemed to be extremely satisfied.  Everything on the food menu is homemade and locally-raised

4) Fries - Yep, the fries deserved their own little section.  $4 gets you a large helping (big enough for 2-3 to share comfortably) along with one of their 10 different dipping sauces.  We went with the beer mustard and the crazy sauce.  Wasn't a big fan of the beer mustard but the crazy sauce was good...essentially a mix of sriracha and homemade ketchup!  

5) Ice Cream - Obviously had to try a little bit of their most eclectic flavor...three chili chocolate. Tastes like rocky road ice cream going in...and then you get a kick to your taste buds through some chili powder towards the end.  Wasn't quite sure if I enjoyed it or not (I finished it all) but it was definitely an interesting experience!

Overall, I really like this place and would recommend it to any group or casual diner.  Prices are in the $9-$12 range for burgers but can quickly add up if you get a ton of the other stuff!",2012-02-02 15:29:03

I ordered 'medium rare' I got well done....umm what? I sent it back and it came back very medium but edging towards medium well...sigh.

The waitress was somewhat attentive and got our appetizer down (came in about 15 minutes) and we ordered our burgers, and waited about 30-40 minutes for those to arrive.  They were good burgers, and unique sauces for the fries we shared.  

At about 8:25 we ordered 3 shakes, 2 dishes of ice cream, and one cone of the anticipated ice cream.  At 9:00 we had not seen the waitress, and the ice cream still had not shown.  I saw the waitress and told her that it had bee 30 minutes and we needed to go, so would she please cancel the ice cream and get my ticket.

Thankfully, B was on board so we headed to Bailey's. Brian and have been here twice together but many other times separately. My usual order is the Smoke Bomb with a side of small chili cheese fries (I'll get to these soon enough). He doesn't have a usual, just whatever he's in the mood for. This time around, I ordered a medium rare Love on the Rocks+chili cheese fries and B chose the medium rare Mediterranean (sans red curry chevre)+regular fries. 

Burgers: The Love on the Rocks is a combo of cocoa dusted beef patty, whiskey apple slaw, cherry jalapeno jam and spicy walnuts. Although I enjoyed the burger, it did not quite hit the spot as well as the Smoke Bomb typically does. The Mediterranean (lamb patty, cucumber relish, roasted red pepper, roasted tomato, red curry chevre) was so-so and was kind of bland. Another thing that I've noticed that happens quite frequently here and in other Saint Louis joints is when I ask for medium rare, there is hardly any rare. Oddly, my burger was more on the well done side and Brian's was actually medium rare. Burger-wise, we don't really feel like the burger lives up to its price and haven't been too impressed by any of the burgers we've tried.

Fries: B's not a huge fan of the fries. He felt they were a bit soggy but appreciates the variety in sauces. I, on the other hand, think that the chili cheese fries are probably one of the best things I have tried on their menu. The cheese, chili, chives, and fries combination work their magic every time for me. 

Ice cream:
After finishing up our meal B was wondering if he felt like having ice cream. I told him yes because A that's how this works and B ice cream is always a good idea. And I wasn't wrong. We chose a scoop of the Pistachio and of the Coconut Crunch. This had to be the best part of the meal for the both of us. The Coconut Crunch has pieces of dark chocolate in it and the Pistachio is absolutely delicious. This ice cream experience was just magnificent. 

Overall, we feel like Bailey's does a good job in providing a lot of options but does not always live up to the price it charges. However, chili cheese fries and the ice cream are the clear winners for us.

She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",2018-03-24 02:44:07

We arrived in St. Louis with a few hours to spare before game time, so we headed over to a burger joint, Bailey's Range, for lunch (I had found it ahead of time via Yelp, naturally). This restaurant was only a few blocks from the stadium and was buzzing with patrons. After fasting for Good Friday, a nice juicy burger accompanied with some fried pickles, french fries, and an ice-cold Coke sounded just right. The space itself was very neat, with large downstairs and upstairs dining areas. There was also an ice cream station at the front of the restaurant, which we sadly did not partake in. 

The service was a bit slow due to the mad rush of soccer fans that they clearly were not expecting, so we were efficient whenever our waitress came by and ordered everything that we needed at once. 

We started with the fried pickles appetizer. The batter was very good and I was suprised to see that the dish included different types of pickles. We then each ordered our burgers (me - the basic burger, my husband - the American burger). Both burgers were cooked to our preference and the toppings were nice, but nothing to write home about. The standout dish was the french fries (note - the large french fry is HUGE, two people could easily split the smaller portion). The ketchup accompanying the fries was very interesting - was there ginger in there? Who knows, but it was good!

His burger was small and the presentation was unappetizing. He said there was very little apple compote, which would have made it better and when I tried it I thought the meat was bland.

Bday parties , families, not a romantic place. a place  you don't want to hang out in for more than an hour or you will leave smelling like fried oil.

wish the time was the only consideration in the 3 star rating. the service was slow and inattentive since all three -- the burgers and the fires came out lukewarm to almost cold. we ordered medium cooked burgers and the bison was well done, hard and lacked any of the described toppings except for a few mushrooms. so it was texture and lack of flavor. the aged burger was good. it was not quite juicy since it was not served warm but it tasted  good enough for a lukewarm burger, I guess. my husband liked it a lot more than me. the fries are fine and the best part were the pickles. 

the beer list is packed with local beer options for half and full pours which is kind of fun since one could try a few different beers at very affordable prices. the wine is considerably pricier and the list very limited, almost discouraging. 
I tried the red blend and it was underwhelming to say the least -- too thin and too sweet.

we noticed other tables were served food before us even though we were seated a good 15-20 minutes before them.

I'll start out with the good.  The atmosphere and service were fantastic.  The person who took my order was friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is spacious and clean.  She suggested the rooster sauce for my fries and I had no complaints about the fries or sauce.  Unfortunately, my burger experience was not so great.  Keep in mind the fact that I was hung over and hadn't eaten since the previous night, so a Big Mac would have been delicious to me.  I ordered the $12 ground lamb burger and was highly anticipating it's lamby goodness.  When the burger arrived, it came with a homemade pickle (good) and homemade ketchup (fantastic).  Now, when I order a burger at an upscale (ish) burger restaurant, I don't expect the burger to be large.   However, I do expect an appropriate bun size that doesn't totally overpower the rest of the sandwich.  In this case, the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the not-so-well-endowed burger patty.  I ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better.

All that said, the sides, shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger, but barely.  I would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic.  Unfortunately it wasn't, and considering burgers are the main draw here, the best rating I can give is an unenthusiastic 3 stars.",2012-02-04 19:45:29

Maybe it's due to the fact that I'm not a burger kind of gal, but impress me, it did not. A group of ten recently had lunch here for my niece's birthday, and I think about 25% of our party enjoyed their meal, while the other 75% shared my way of thinking. 

We were seated right away, which is a definite plus for having such a large group. However, they sat us at this super long table in the center of the space where it was impossible to hold a conversation with anyone other than the person directly across from you or next to you. Whatever, I had a headache and didn't feel like being too social anyway. The waitress came around to take our drink order, and most people at the table ordered a shake. I'm on a current health kick, so I had ice tea instead. When the shakes arrived, I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything though. The small size was just that... super tiny... like, two dixie cups worth in a glass tiny. Definitely not worth the $3.50 price tag. 

On to the food. Everything here is served a la carte. Most of the specialty burgers come at a set price, but if you order the basic and add anything to it, we found that you could be up another $4 or more just by switching your bun and adding a slice of cheese and bacon. You want a side of fries or onion rings? That'll be a few more dollars. Oh, you expect silverware? How much is it worth to you? (Ok, they don't really charge for silverware, but you get where I'm going with this... I hate being nickeled and dimed for every little thing!) Everyone in our group ordered something different, and though I don't recall what each person got, I only heard the verdict from everyone as we were walking out (note the 25% / 75% above). I had the veggie burger and quinoa side salad. The veggie burger was decent. It was a sweet potato patty topped with pecan butter and spinach. The quinoa salad was not my favorite and I was actually proud of myself for finishing at least half of it. It's served cold and mixed with dried cherries, onions, and balsamic vinaigrette. The onions were overbearing though... that's the only flavor that came through.

At least the birthday girl enjoyed her shake, but as for me, I don't expect that Bailey's will get another nickel or dime from my wallet anytime in the near future.",2014-04-21 14:51:44

Bailey's and all their restaurants are great and so is the Range. 3.5 stars would be a truthful number. Mainly, I round down because of their service. My reasoning for the almighty stars would be as follows: 

4 - amazing food. quality ingredients with chefs who know how to experiment with flavors that go together better than you and your girlfriend (boyfriend). I have not heard anyone saying they do not like their burgers. They are small (errrr. Gourmet) in portion but big in flavor. Sauces are hit and miss, french fries are good to great, and everything I've eaten or tried off another plate was a big hit, except for the patty melt which is a bust. My stove does better than theirs for this regard. 

3.5 - price point again is the Achilles heel for all Bailey's places to me. I am from Chicago. When I want to pay Chicago prices I usually end up going to all the best places in Chicago. St. Louis has been rated one of the most cost effective cities to live in recently - NOT because of the Range, Chocolate Bar, Rooster, etc. 

3 - The service is average, at best. The staff is friendly? (not rude), slow, and I find it hard to remember a time when they have gone out of their way. It is as if they are not working for tips. 

Sure, the Bailey's restaurants are sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving...I love that. But please hire some people who are also sleek, sexy, cool, and important to the city evolving.",2013-09-07 17:10:06

Wildfire burger (medium rare) - I couldn't tell where the ""wildfire"" descriptor came from. I couldn't taste any of the toppings (did dig around looking for chipotle mayo and think I found it on the bottom bun). The meat was good and soft, but the burger as a whole tasted mostly plain.

Fries - Crispy and hot. So good. I was able to split this with another person.

Red curry catsup - Tasted like how I thought Sriracha catsup should taste.

Regular catsup - I could have sworn this was the curry catsup because it definitely tasted like it had curry powder in it.

Pistachio shake - Pretty good with lots of pistachios! The flavor was intense.

[10/23/14]: My second visit here solidified my 3-star impression, although now it's a pretty weak 3 stars. The coconut crunch shake was good, but my classic burger was dry and plain-tasting.

Nobody really talks much about the enormous amount of flavored bottled sodas you can try (we tried a Green River lime soda and a Reed's spiced apple soda - fantastic). Lots of mention about the shakes, but not much was said about the homemade ice cream desserts that they have. I was expecting the typical burger bar and got so much more!

The atmosphere is super cool. Two stories, with the longest communal table you ever will see and a bar. Upstairs has traditional seating that overlooks downstairs and also has bar-type seating around the perimeter of the windows. The kitchen is exposed on the first level, separated from the dining room with various gigantic window panes.

We started with the smoked onion rings - some of the best I've ever had - with Rooster sauce (awesome mix of stone grain mustard and mayo). For dinner, I went with one of the ""burger war"" beef burgers - espresso rubbed, topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and apple slivers. It was awesome! The flavors totally worked and it was obvious the ingredients were all high quality. We split fries with their cheese sauce - fries were great and the cheese sauce was good, but not your typical - it was very light in color and had hints of white wine. Pretty good, but not as good as the Rooster sauce. For dessert, we split scoops of pistachio and salted caramel ice cream. We made it a sundae (chocolate, whipped cream, and nuts) for $2 more - the premium mixed nuts on top made the up charge more than worth it.

Service was top-notch. Very helpful, answered every question knowledgeably, was around enough but not too much.

The only complaint and the only thing from keeping this a 5-star review is the fact that they serve the burgers on cold buns. It got to the point where I started eating my burger with a fork to work around the bun. It looks like they bake them on site, so I'm not sure why they wouldn't take the extra step to toast them before they serve you. They do have an option of a pretzel roll for $1 more, so maybe I'll try that next time...because I'll definitely be back!",2012-03-02 15:43:30

When I had finally read about the plans for this place I was instantly excited.  Each passing day walking past and seeing the brown paper that had once shuddered the windows reveal what I could only hope was another awesome restaurant experience in Downtown.  

I could hardly wait for lunch on Friday as I and several other co-workers embarked down Olive to have lunch at this new establishment. We were promptly greeted and seated since we were veterans of the downtown lunch scene (go early or don't go is the motto) and looked over our choices. We were seated at the long table which is a new dining experience in itself since other parties can be (and were) seated directly next to hours.  This didn't bother me one bit but some of my co-workers were a little take aback by it and wanted to have some more space.  I ended up going with just the basic burger although the Dave's Smoked Burger and the Black and Blue sounded amazing, I thought it best to just go with the Basic for now.  I added the house cheddar sauce and a small order of fries with the house mayo.  

Looking over the menu there are a wide variety of toppings/additions and sauces that you can pair with any of the burgers which means you never have to try the same combination twice.  Also, there is an expansive soda fountain-esque menu for different types of soda or ""pop"" as it is called in some areas along with numerous different Shake/Malt concoctions that can be served with or without booze in them.  These drink menus made me think if Crown Candy and the Chocolate Bar ever got together for a one night stand, this restaurant would be the result of that encounter. 

The service was a bit on the slow side and I will chalk that up to the system used, the sheer number of people who walked in after us, and seating arrangement used in the place. While the decorative old windows that are suspended around the cooking and prep areas are very cool to look at, I don't think it will be long before they are replaced with something less transparent.  

Back to the food, my Burger had arrived and it was cooked to temperature (medium) expertly.  The only thing I could fault with it was that the house cheese sauce is actually a sauce and not very thick so it had rolled off the burger and onto the plate.  I could barely taste it but the burger itself was flavorful.  The fries were great as well and I did enjoy the mayo that accompanied it on the side.  The Chipolte mayo got the most rave reviews from the table though so it is something I'll have to try next time.  We all agreed at the end of our meal that we weren't overly stuffed or full but satisfied, which was a nice feeling to have rather than feel bloated or miserable.

I wasn't feeling a burger so I got a cup of chili and fries with regular ketchup.  I was so confused about the chili when I first got it because it looked like it was potato soup.  Turns out, they put beer cheese on top of it.  It was awesome.  There were a lot of beans in the chili.  I'm not normally a fan of beans, but they tasted fine in the chili.  The fries were really good too.  I tried the beer cheese sauce, homemade ketchup, and the truffle/garlic aioli.  The homemade ketchup was so interesting. I think there was cinnamon in it.  I loved all three of them.  

I tried the drinks and they were great, especially they strawberry basil and cherry limeade.

The best part about our meal had nothing to do with the restaurant.  We were here for my sister's bachelorette party.  There was a convention in town so a big group of them were at the restaurant.  They heard that my sister was getting married so they offered to pay our entire table's bill.  It was 8 people so it must have been close to $150.  They also bought us all shots and had the entire restaurant sing ""happy wedding day"" to my sister.  It was a really fun experience.

I went in at 2 in the afternoon for lunch on a very busy afternoon and sat at the bar by myself.

The bartender acknowledged me quickly and took my drink order, a lemonade. This is where it got hazy. He was so overwhelmed making drinks for all of the tables that after 15 minutes I still didn't have my drink and all he could do is keep looking down the bar every few minutes to let me know he realized I was still there.

For appetizers we tried the Fried Pickles and Smoked Jalapeño Chicken Wings. Our party enjoyed both appetizers. The pickles were perfect with a delightful batter. If you are a fan of jalapeños please order the chicken wings...the jalapeño flavor is very prevalent.

As far as the burgers are concerned we ordered Dave's Chop House, 
the Gyro, Carolina Bison, and the Buffalo. 

The Gyro was our least favorite mainly because it didn't taste like a Gyro. The lamb meat was very bland and the cucumber sauce was nonexistent. 

The Buffalo was juicy and flavorful; it tasted as expected.

Dave's burger was just ok. We were looking to taste more bacon but the rosemary was overwhelming. I ended up taking the meat and just eating it without the bread and toppings.

The Carolina Bison was the overall favorite! Just Delicious.

We gave three stars because all of the meat was fantastic...fresh and awesome but we were disappointed in just a few things which took the score down. 

1. It was overly warm in the restaurant; as though the air wasn't on and no ice was offered for our waters.  After a baseball game and walking to the restaurant it would've been nice to walk into a cool place.

2. We all had ice cream and felt it was subpar; mainly because it was melting so fast. I ordered the Sweet Sweet Bacon Shake and was disappointed when it arrived with NO BACON & no explanation. 10 minutes after the shake arrived I was told they were out of the bacon...my whole reason for ordering the shake. The shake had a great flavor but I'm sure it would've been more awesome with the bacon.

3.  The fries were below standard. When you pay 12+ dollars for a burger you expect great fries to accompany that burger. The many dipping sauces were fine but these fries were obviously frozen not terrible but frozen. Fresh cut fries to go with the extremely fresh burger would've been better.",2015-08-09 15:34:41

They are my favorite restaurateurs in the downtown STL area - even though each place is very different in niche, cuisine, hours, decor, each has the impression of being well thought-through for what it is.

So, what Range is - a modern update of the soda bar / roller-skate-wearing carhop burger joints of yore. No, you don't pull up in your car and get served by comely ladies in skates, but the food is pure americana: burgers, fries, shakes, and floats. Except did we mention: *boozy* shakes and *boozy* floats? Yes. I would put on my bobby socks for these.

The  interior is dominated by a large bar-height table that runs the length of the restaurant, with stools for seating (we should add: there is also a bar-height bar that runs the length of the restaurant, parallel to the table ;-). Perhaps a bit off-putting to the standard middle-american diner, who seems to prefer maintaining a certain distance from (gasp!) other people, but we found it charming. Came in on a super-busy Friday night but nonetheless had maybe a 10 minute wait for a spot for 2 (which was just right for ordering drinks at the bar).

The burger menu includes many inventive takes on the classic, and it seems you can substitute different kinds of patties (pork, chicken, bison, lamb, veggie) for the free-range cow patties if you so desire (some burgers appear to be crafted around the type of meat involved, so sub at your own risk). We went exotic with the PB&J (Bison with arugula Pesto, goat cheese, and tomato jam) and the smoking duck burgers - the former was just... do it. You will not be sad. The duck was OK - nothing wrong with it, but in comparison to the PB&J it was a little boring. You should just order two sides of fries rather than one large - costs less, plus you get to try more sauces. The rooster is the same spicy/creamy sauce served on top of the crepes at the Rooster, and the homemade catsup was just fine. Haven't tried the others yet.

The big winner, though, is the boozy horchata milkshake: an invention that should have come to be long before now. You will somehow make room for it, we promise.

They have a fun Survivor-style competition where each week, two burgers ""face off"" in a battle - the one that gets ordered more gets to stay on the menu. Should keep things interesting over time - great idea for nom longevity.",2012-01-08 00:21:24

I love that the beef is grassfed - you can't find this at many places - and that they are so many types of meat to choose from. I had the PB&J, which was our bartender's favorite. The burgers themselves were smaller and thicker, which left us with some extra bun at the end, but we all still enjoyed the flavor combinations.  We also shared a large order of fries, which was the perfect amount for 3 without overstuffing us.
Between us 3, we ordered a pitcher of the Cherry Limeade.  It was perfect for a hot day and definitely worth it if everyone in your group wants to drink.  I was worried it would be too sweet, but the lime balances it out.

Both the bread and the burger were charred which gave every bite a bitter charcoal taste. The fries were limp and soggy, as if they were neglected at the pass.

The only upside was the desserts. We shared a strawberry sorbet and a pistachio / cookies & cream in a waffle bowl. Both were amazing. The sorbet was tangy and tasted of real fruit. The ice cream was creamy and rich on top of a freshly made waffle bowl (still warm!).

From Brooklyn to the Bay Area, everybody loves talking about their favorite burger joint, their ode to the Earl of Sandwich's industrialized counterpart. The sandwich, as well as the burger, has really come full circle this century. Once designed to be a quick, no-frills meal for the industrial era's worker, who had neither the time nor luxury to prepare much else, the burger has now evolved into a serious culinary contender, a gourmet choice for the open-minded foodie and traditional diner alike. 

In Philly, for example, you'll hear Center City locals rave about the Shake Shack, or if they're peering through a lace curtain, you might even hear a whisper about the burgers at Butcher & Singer, or Barclay Prime. I'm not going to lie, Stephen Starr knows how to make himself a burger. My friend lives near a burger place in Brooklyn that still drifts into my dreams on occasion. They've got this back patio, great vibe, but all I really remember is that juicy, insurmountable cheeseburger. 

That brings us to Baileys' Range, which now holds a deserving place atop my gourmet burger list. Not only was the Ozark burger one of the most absurdly delicious cheeseburgers I've ever tasted, but given the other options, it was a very difficult choice. The ABC with apples, bacon, and camembert - uh, yes please. The homemade ice cream and milkshakes, the root beer floats with Fitz's Root Beer, the fries with the rooster sauce: this place doesn't have a specialty, it has a dozen. For your 6 year-old or your 60 year-old, your straight-laced burger fan or your boozy friend that wants a cocktail with ice cream - the adult root beer float, for example - Baileys' Range has something for everyone.

In addition to all of this, the portions are small but satisfying and the service is friendly and fast. They really put elbow grease into the decor, a perfect blend of contemporary urban and classic diner. It's not just another Steak N' Shake; Baileys' is its own brand, its own product. I mean, I can't tell you how many burgers I've eaten in my life, so for one to stand out like this must mean its special.

One of the few ""Bailey's"" restaurants you'll find around STL. The biggest thing I love about these places is the ""Farm-to-table"" food. Menus revolving around the season, locally sourced meats for the burgers, and heck, even the tap beer selection is local! I enjoy the selection of unique beef, bison or even goat burgers, as well as trying the variety of dipping sauces for your fries. You feel like you are dining in a cleaned up barn while here...and I mean that in a good way. The decor appears to have been salvaged parts of farm houses and barns. Adding to the home on the range feeling and something I've never seen anywhere else (other than an Amish family restaurant) is the long ""family-style"" table running through the middle of the building. It encourages sitting next to strangers and making new friends! I love it.

It was super cute and casual inside which was perfect after a day at the city museum climbing. 

I was in love with their special ketchup and my husband loved the spicy pickles they served with the burgers. The food was great and we topped it off with a banana split! We would definitely visit it again and recommend to anyone else going to downtown St. Louis.

That may not sound like a lot...but I also live in Las Vegas. I found out about Bailey's Range on Yelp as I was looking for a good selection of local beers at a place that would be open between lunch and dinner. The local beer selection is excellent and the staff who work the bar seem to know quite a bit about the beer. Of my three visits, two of them included the best service I've received in St. Louis.

I have had 3 different burgers for  each of my three trips. The most recent was a Big Popper, which is my favorite. I've also had Dave's Chop House and The Carolina. After my three different burgers I will believe that they do not serve a bad one. The fries are also a favorite, as well as having some of the best fried pickles I've ever eaten. I am still dreaming about them. 

I have also sampled a couple of the lemonade cocktails which are both strong and refreshing.

The first floor is open to the second floor, lending itself to increased noise level, which it was the night we were there. Burger joints seem to be the ""in"" thing and this is a burger joint, but definitely an upscale one, both in their offerings and their prices. 

Another 'hook' is the option to have your burger made from a variety of sources: bison, lamb, beef, pork, chicken or veggie. All cooked to order and on your choice of bun. Some of their condiments were unfamiliar to our group (sriracho mayo, rooster sauce). All in all, an interesting concept. Our burgers were good, but we all agreed they didn't make it on our ""best ever"" list. And $11-$12 for a burger is pretty steep in my world - you're obviously paying for the concept & cutesy atmosphere rather than a well-executed burger. And when you add in drinks and dessert, it ends up being a pretty pricey night out, especially with a family.

Service was so-so. The hostesses seemed pre-occupied with their own conversation. Our server was friendly and answered all our questions about the menu, but she was pretty much MIA after she took our order.

They're definitely a popular Central West End spot on weekends, so I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation ahead of time via Yelp or Waitlist app.

When we arrived and checked in with the hostess, she said it would still be about a 30 minute wait for our party of 4. A little surprising as we had placed ourselves in line via the Yelp app 30 mins prior on our drive there, but nonetheless we grabbed drinks at the bar after a few minutes of waiting. Our table was ready by the time we received our drinks (didn't take the whole 30 mins).

The overall atmosphere is a very unique one for the STL area. They have a very long bar downstairs with an equally long set of high top tables to eat at and a gigantic wall of antique glass windows. We were seated upstairs which consists mainly of 4-6 person tables that either overlook the main floor or the side streets of the restaurant.

With them being so busy on weekends and usually having a full house, it can get pretty noisy in the restaurant as they have concrete walls with little insulation. Don't expect to have a intimate conversation at your table.

Burgers are excellent quality overall and the fries are always crispy and perfectly cooked. I had the Whiskey BBQ Burger and was very satisfied with my choice. They have a wide selection of sauces to try too, I highly recommend the Roster Sauce. My only pet peeve is that the burgers are pretty pricey ($10+) and a little on the smaller size and they don't come with a side.

Our table split a pitcher of the Peach Ginger Spiked Lemonade and it was delicious! The picture was enough for all 4 of us to have at least 2 servings each. They're famous for their boozy shakes, but we didn't partake in any of those.

In addition, when they didn't have a cream soda I wanted, she suggested an excellent alternative (Virgil black berry cream soda ). She also brought the food directly out to me when it was ready. Very pleasant and quick service overall. 

Food: Got the fire & smoke burger recommended by the awesome waitress. The size seemed small, but when I bit into it, definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was a bit greasy, but I think that was because it was so juicy. The flavors were a perfect blend of fresh meat, spiciness, and melted cheese. Really couldn't get enough of the way it was cooked. The bread was also different from other types of bread and added to the unique texture of the burger that was sprinkled with crisps. The whole burger really came together with its complex flavors and texture. Not sure how to describe it so would just recommend trying it for yourself!

I love the quirky interior, the extensive menu and of course the fun, boozy shakes. What I haven't loved (consistently) is the service. It's so hit or miss. Sometimes it's on, sometimes we're waiting 30 minutes for someone just to come to the table and greet us after we're seated. We're usually pretty laid back and/or not in a rush because we're catching up with friends or something and it doesn't really matter but, if I had to nit-pick SOMETHING, that would be it. That said, I did just have to call to have a receipt emailed to me (for work purposes/expenses) and they were incredibly helpful. So see, it's just hard to pick on them that much. 

As far as the food goes, I love the Buffalo Chicken sandwich - super juicy, has yet to be dry like chicken can sometimes be in patty form. The ""Aw Jam"" was pretty great too!

Mrs. S and I were excited to finally be in the area for dinner, as we are huge fans of Bailey's Chocolate Bar, and figured we would love the Range just as much.  

However, we were displeased with our visit!

For starters, I had been joking about he new trends with bacon flavored deserts, and joked about checking the menu for a bacon shake.  Little did I know there was a bacon shake on their ""boozy"" menu.  I was feeling adventurous so I ordered this mixture of ice cream, caramel, candied bacon and Makers Mark liquor.  At $9 it was one of those situations that I generally avoid, because $9 for a drink that I know NOTHING about is a risk I just don't take.  And if I ever had any questions of WHY I don't take these risks, the bacon shake did it for me.  This shake is tasted in levels.  First you get the liquor (YUMMY!).  That's your first sip, ice cream and liquor.  Next you get the caramel.  By the third or fourth drink, I was getting chunks of bacon.  Not so yummy at this point. For me it wasn't about the bacon alone.  It was the tremendously sweet caramel, with the salty yet sweet bacon, all mixed into one thing.  It was too sweet, too much to handle, and at $9, too much money to go out on a limb for.  

For dinner, I ordered a bison burger (forgot to order cheese!) with fries and honey mustard sauce.  Mrs. S got a regular burger with fries and cheese sauce.  My burger was decent, not bad, but not the best.  Mrs. S was not as excited about her burger, mostly because the ketchup wasn't your every day flavor.  I tolerated the different style but I honestly just am not a fan.  As for the fries, they were good.  The cheese sauce was much better than the honey mustard, mostly because the honey mustard tasted more like spicy mustard.  Maybe a mistake was made, maybe not, hard to say.

All in all, Bailey's Range was just ""ok"" for me and the wife.  I am torn between 2 and 3 stars as I write this review, for the simple fact that if someone were visiting and asked to go here, I would probably suggest passing on it, (at least if I was expected to be a part of the group) and point them in a different direction.  I think the most fair review I can give here is 3 stars, as part of my issue with Bailey's Range has to do with taste, and for me this isn't my style of food.  Service and atmosphere are both ok as well, but really when I think of a 4-5 star place, it should transcend tastes and be inviting for people who usually do not eat a certain style of meal or cooking.  Bailey's does not do this for me.  It's not exceptional to me.  It's just, ""ok.""

So here goes, 3 stars for Bailey's Range and a new list for my followers.  Just not my cup of tea.  A fair rating for a place that just isn't my cup of tea, but some might still find value in the experience.  That seems fair, right?",2013-10-04 21:06:50

Plus, I was a little confused because the menu description for my burger listed bacon jam but I didn't taste any.

Here's the kicker. Nearly 30 minutes into our meal, the waiter approaches our table with two more burgers. He told us our food was here but awkwardly stuttered as he walked away after we told him he was at the wrong table. A light bulb flashed in my head and I realized that those burgers were actually the ones we ordered. We had been eating the wrong ones! The waiter knew this when he saw the food on our table and craftily walked away, trying to hide this. This place doesn't deserve 1 star because the food, although bland and overpriced, was edible.

Ambience: This place is located in a busy corner of downtown STL. Parking is street only, just like most places in downtown. When you come inside, you'll notice, this restaurant is pretty big. You almost never need a reservation but it is good to have one for larger parties. The crowd is here everything from families to college friends to tourists.

Food: The place offers Missouri raised grass fed beef. So you know you're getting good stuff. If you're not into beef, their chicken burgers are also really good. I will say though their vegetarian patties aren't as flavorful. I have been to very few burger places that can do a good veggie patty. After all, this is a burger joint. We hope you didn't come here for veggie patty. We asked for ketchup and they had a house made version. I'll say, I'm not a fan of it. It tastes like puree than ketchup. The sauces on burgers could use some inspiration. They have the basics such as siracha, mayo, mustard, bbq... But if you really want to set your burger apart, step up your game on the sauce!

Drinks: They have a pretty nice bar with TVs, if you're looking for a place to eat by yourself. With that said their spiked shakes are pretty awesome. If you haven't, you should try their normal shakes and ice cream too!

Service: It was pretty busy when we came here, yet the service was fast. Our server cared for what we wanted and checked up on us a few times.

Price: $12-$14 for a burger with no sides is alright. You could throw fries with it and charge extra for other sides such as sweet potato fries or onion rings. Still can't complain.",2017-12-06 03:55:22

It was definitely hopping. Our waiter took our order right away because we wanted to go quickly so we could get to the game. 

I started with a rosemary white peach boozy lemonade. It was delicious! Good sized and perfectly flavored. They have lots of variations of fruity boozy drinks, which I love. It was hard to decide what to get. My dining partners each got something different, and each liked theirs. 

For my meal, I knew I had to try the veggie burger, which has changed since my last (dismal) review. Now it is described as ""sweet potato patty, pecan butter, sage aioli, spinach."" I wasn't so sure about the toppings but got it as is because I wanted to try how they had hopefully improved the flavors since last time. My husband and I also ordered a large order of fries with sriracha catsup and cheddar sauce. 

Our drinks took awhile to come but the food was quick. And.... REDEMPTION!!!! This veggie burger was DELICIOUS. SO MUCH BETTER than it used to be! The flavors of the aioli and pecan butter were perfect with the earthy flavor of the burger. The bun was so soft and fresh. Just wonderful. I ate it all up. The fries here are really good, and the sauces also were. They bring bigger portions than they did the last time I went. The total bill for 2 drinks, 2 burgers and a large fry was about $40 without tip. A little pricey, but good for the quality and location.

We ordered the burgers well done which we regretted due to them being overdone and very dry.  However the flavor combinations of both burgers were quite tasty.  Our server was really slow and not because she was busy with other tables.  She just took extremely long to get anything we needed like more napkins, drink refills and our food.  She quickly picked up the bill to cash out our payment though.  She also was a bit rude in her service to us.  It was lunch time we were short on time so it felt too long of a visit, over one hour to get some burgers and fries.  We got our ice cream to go again as to get done on time.  On the plus side our servie at the ice cream station was very quick and super friendly.

Tasty burgers, although I felt that they were smaller than I was expecting, given normal restaurant fare.  The two we tried were both excellent, and I think the [many] other choices are likely to be the same.  Additionally, it is not the most clear thing, but no sides are included with your burger, so we ordered a couple of appetizers, as I thought that was what I was reading on the menu.  I approved of the fried pickles, but I was less impressed with the loaded fries and pretzels; loaded fries would have been better served with a description of their load, I wasn't expecting pulled pork (and it was quite substantial chunks as well), which I felt took away from the dish, and the pretzels were pretzel ""puffs"" and not quite my style, definitely not a traditional pub pretzel appetizer.  As mentioned, fried pickles get a plus from me, they were done disc style and came with a nice dipping sauce.  Finally, the aesthetic is... 70s/80s kitchen with quaint jar glasses and flower containers (at least in the second floor).  I found the faux kitsch annoying, but maybe it will click with you.

Got to try out Bailey's Range Friday night for dinner with friends. This place is huge: two floors with downstairs comprised mostly of one large community table and some bar seating. We were seated upstairs where it was as equally noisy as downstairs- which I don't mind, especially for a Friday night. 

While their extensive drink menu was impressive, we all stuck to our usual wine of choice. However, I would be interested in trying one of the alcoholic lemonades on another visit. The food menu is also extensive for only serving burgers. There are some extremely creative burgers and protein choices but for those burger traditionalists you can build your own. 

I opted for one of the battling burgers that day (two burgers listed on the menu, and which ever one gets ordered more stays on the menu longer to battle another burger!). The one I chose was the Chicken Capri- a chicken patty with fresh mozzarella, a roasted tomato, basil and a balsamic reduction! I also got a side of fries with their crazy catsup (catsup and sriracha). All of which was delicious! My only criticism would be that my bun was a bit too dry for my liking. It was even drier the next day when I ate the other half of the burger for lunch. On the other hand, the chicken patty was STILL juicy and just as delicious even as leftovers!

She offered to take it back again but I said it was OK because by that time everyone else was done eating and we left it at that.  The burger was excellent the way it was I can't imagine how great it would have been if it was cooked the way I wanted.

I had Dave's chop house burger the first time and had it cooked medium rare. It was bloodier than the typical medium rare and was not as good as I had anticipated. I ordered it after reading the rave reviews, but it just didn't really wow me. Thinking that my first experience must have been a fluke (because really, the Yelp reviews indicate otherwise), I came back again with two other friends. This time I ordered the pb and j, which is also another favorite among yelpers. I asked for medium rare again (true carnivore here) with a side of fries with ketchup and their signature rooster sauce.

Boy. 

The burger was absolutely delicious. I don't even like goat cheese, but every ingredient blended so well together that I actually enjoyed the goat cheese. I also like pickles so having a pickle on the side was a nice touch. The fries were very delicious and the rooster sauce did not disappoint. I would suggest ordering an additional sauce that is lighter if you're also going to order a mayo based sauce.

We went on a Saturday evening where the temp was still 95 at 7pm, this is important because we were told the wait would be ten minutes and it was at least a half hour. The waiting area was hotter than it was outside. Everyone waiting was miserable. Once we got seated the temperature improved a little but there was not enough air for the space or the volume. I was also unimpressed by the burgers. The price is high (9-12) per burger and this does not include anything except a burger, homemade ketchup (which I did not care for) and a pickle (which was exquisite). Also they ask you how you would like your burger cooked. If it is ground meat there should NOT be any red/pink. So naturally to avoid getting sick I asked for medium well. My burger was dry and lacking in taste overall (I choose the special smoke and fire). My date's burger was slightly better (he got the American) but I was still not won over especially for the price.

Now to the good. The wait staff was friendly and attentive (not so much the host...but that might be attributed to the heat). The drinks were superb (I got the sweet raspberry ice tea and was blown away!) and my date enjoyed one of his favorite local beers from their extensive selection. The fries were good (I recommend asking for them well done) and the homemade cheese sauce and horsey mayo were delicious dip choices. Also the crowning glory was the sweet sweet bacon milkshake we shared for dessert. This is an epic bacon, bourbon, caramel wonder that you will never forget. I don't even care for bourbon and this stole my heart.

First, it was horribly hot inside the place, even at 7:30pm.  The hostess said it had been like that for days. We had a big group split between two tables.  The first table got their food 15 minutes before the second table.  The second table ordered an appetizer that didn't come out until the rest of the food did.  The appetizer came with a side of cheese sauce that had just enough to cover the bottom of the bowel.  The server immediately said he would get more.  One person ordered a bison burger that they did not get but were still charged for.  We had a kid's grilled cheese that we had to send back because it was burnt.  Two other people ordered their burgers ordered medium burgers that came out raw.  The general manager even agreed that it was unacceptable.  She tried to over to fix it but the two of us had lost our appetites at that point.  She said she would do some ""magic"" to the bill, which ended up only being removing the two dishes that we sent back.  Also, if you have a group of more than 8 people, they can't split checks, because that would take witchcraft, I guess.

What we ordered:
Horchata boozy milkshake
Lime in the Coconut chicken burger (from their burger war of the week)
Fries

The horchata was very very tasty - thick and creamy.  But hardly felt or tasted any of the alcohol in it.  So was disappointed to be paying $9 for essentially a milkshake. 

The burger - at a price of $11 (for a burger alone, no sides included), we had expectations of a decent sized burger - and with neither of us being overly hungry, we decided to split.  We were very disappointed by the serving size - the burger was so tiny that it would have hardly fed one of us if we were hungry.  As for taste - well, we left underwhelmed.  The chicken burger was very dry and had little flavor of its own (and we've had some incredible chicken burgers before.)  The toppings were nothing at all reminiscent of lime or coconut, and were very very sparse. 

The fries - here the serving size was ginormous.  We did not expect that many fries for $2, which I guess is a good thing since our burger was so tiny.   They were tasty, and loved all the choices of dipping sauces!  


Kudos however for gluten free buns (at no up charge). The texture was way off on it, but at least it held together. 

The building itself was interesting, but the acoustics downright miserable. We couldn't even talk to one another across the table it was so loud in there.

We were greeted by a single table stretching the length of the lower floor, running alongside the open kitchen. I liked the thrift-store chic look of the décor - old windows hanging from the ceiling, mason jars for water glasses, milk jug lanterns for lighting. It's also nice that the entire kitchen is open for the diners to see. 

I was happy to see their large, varied draft selection, and thrilled when I realized that all but a single guest tap are beers from St. Louis breweries. I was less thrilled to see the prices - 5 or 7 dollars for a pint seems steep, even for the high quality beers available. My party stuck to the mixed drinks, which come in three varieties: boozy lemonade, boozy milkshakes, and icepicks. My strawberry basil lemonade was good, if a bit light on the basil flavor, but the star of the evening was the Sweet Sweet Bacon. Perhaps the most indulgent item I have ever seen on a menu, this milkshake contains bourbon, salted caramel ice cream, and candied bacon. It tasted as amazing as it sounds, and it definitely earned the ""boozy"" title.

I ordered the Buzzed burger, a beef patty rubbed in espresso topped with onion, bacon, blue cheese, and apple. I asked for it medium but it came well-done, though I was the only one at my table to whom this happened. The burger itself was a bit disappointing. The bold flavors seemed to fight rather than complement each other, the blue cheese being the worst offender. I tried my friend's LGBT, a beef patty topped with arugula, goat cheese, bacon and tomato, and found it to be far superior. We also got an ABC, with apples, bacon, and camembert, which was excellent. All of the burgers came with ketchup, though I can't imagine anyone actually putting any on these elaborately topped burgers. Special note goes to the dill pickles served on the side - they're house-made and delicious.

None of the burgers came with fries, so we ordered a large order that came with two side sauces. The number of sauces available is impressive, I plan to return just to try some of the other ones. We got the rooster sauce (pretty good) and the crazy catsup (excellent). The fries themselves were tasty but had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. This surprised me, especially given the atmosphere of fresh, honest cooking given by the open kitchen.

The service was some of the best I've experienced in a while. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. When my friend asked her to recommend a dessert, she immediately ran and fetched a sample of the salted caramel ice cream, which is made in house. All of the wait staff seemed to be having a good time, which was a refreshing change from the surly servers one often sees in burger joints.

Overall, I liked Bailey's Range. The shakes, atmosphere, and décor were all excellent. If they fix their execution problems (overcooked burger, stale fries) and lower the price on their beer they could easily get bumped up to 4-5 stars.",2012-04-02 23:06:01

No skill, no flavor, and no creativity coming out this kitchen for sure. Bailey's, get it together please! 

Pickles were pretty good, however, my preference for fried foods is breadcrumbs, not tasteless easy to prepare batter. The rest of this review, however, is truly not based off of my preference but on common sense burger expectations! 

Their burgers should all be called sliders. They are SO small and thin, and just thrown between cold yoga-mat ingredient buns onto an overcompensated oven tray with thin measly toppings hanging off the side. 

First of all, I asked the waitress how pink their medium burger is, and she said ""its mostly pink, because the medium-well has barely a sliver of pink."" So I ordered a medium Ballpark pretzel burger, and my husband ordered a medium American burger. Unfortunately, mine came out completely bone dry well done! My husband's burger came out medium-well but barely any pink. 

In addition to the dry overcooked meat, we both cringed at the taste of the CHEESE SAUCE on our burgers!!! Oh my goodness gracious, IDK if it was homemade cheese sauce or from a can, but it tasted absolutely horrendous, like a cheap peanut butter cheese wiz sauce! 

So I said no way, please make me a totally different burger (the Basic create your own now with sliced white cheddar, bacon, and red onion) medium this time!
My husband was starving so he just ate his (he has more tolerance for the BS these restaurants are serving up these days anyways!).

My SECOND burger comes out now, so the waitress asks that I cut into it for her and sure enough it is hard as a brick and more well done than the first one! I didn't think it was possible! But before I could say anything the waitress said ""OMG I am so sorry"" and grabbed it away to get yet another one made for me!

My THIRD burger comes out, and my husband is done eating his ""slider"" by now, so I cut into the burger again for the waitress and now there is only a sliver of pink. Definitely not medium, and closer to medium well but even more chewy than the first one!!! The waitress said is this ok? I said not really, but my husband is already done, and I wanna leave!!! So I took a few bites out of the third burger and left the rest for my husband who was still clearly starving after eating his mini snack of a slider! (The attached photo is of the 3rd burger before I gave it to my husband). 

It was SO bad, even besides being extremely dry and overcooked. It was truly tasteless, and a little chewy. Did they just shape ground beef into a patty and call it a burger?! I mean really, no seasonings, no splash of personality or creativity to make it their own RANGE burger?! I have had tastier juicer burgers at whole-in-the-wall diners!!!

Oh, and the buns!!! Have you ever seen those kids kitchen play sets with the squishy burger bun that takes it original shape back as soon as you let it go? Yeah, that's exactly how both the pretzel bun and regular bun was! Ew, I think that was the worst part. They were COLD, greasy, and must have had the yoga-mat ingredient in it!!! A burger bun should be slightly toasted, fresh, and lightly buttered. The bun should be the second most important ingredient to the meat. 

The toppings were pathetic. My red onions were thinner than the red onions in the watermelon salad and looked as if they were soaking in water and lost their freshness! The bacon was not crispy or worthy at all, it was floppy and chewy. 

My husbands burger, the American burger (with macaroni and cheese, and bacon) HAD A MELON BALLER DOLUP OF MAC' n CHEESE, and tons of that questionable cheese sauce. HE TOO, said ""whoaaa what's going on with that sauce?"" and made a confused face! 

THANK GOODNESS for the French fries and watermelon salad or else I would have left starving! The fries were really good, actually. They were warm, had seasonings, and seemed fresh. Watermelon salad wasn't the best but wasn't bad, it was actually refreshing. 

The bourbon bacon milkshake was pretty good too because it had chopped bacon in the mix, as well as two strips sticking out. 

The brussels sprouts looked so disgraceful and lonely with their lack-luster wilted cherry tomatoes and HALF-MELTED cheese on top, all scattered in an oversized casserole dish. 

It's actually funny now thinking about this meal. BURGERS are their main item and they failed miserably. I don't know how they stay in business, or how people can rant and rave about this place! It's not like I got ONE BAD BURGER, I HAD THREE! Make that FOUR if you count my husbands dry ol' sad slider-sized burger!

There is also an extensive drinks menu of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks (a little bit overwhelming if you're indecisive like me...).

We waited quite awhile for our server to show and were eventually taken care of by an employee who wasn't our server. Because we'd waited so long we knew everything we wanted to order. My wife has a gluten sensitivity, so thankfully they were able to provide a bun for her. Their Boozy milkshakes were delicious, but the rest of the food was just okay. We started with the house chips, which came to us cold. I asked our server if they normally came like that, and he said yes. This surprised me, as most locations with house chips serve them fresh from the fryer. I think they would've been better if they were warm--but we were so hungry that we had no problem finishing them.

The burgers are quite small for what you pay, but with the beef being grass fed and local, I could see why. Neither my wife or I were blown away by the burger, but I've never met a burger I didn't like, so it did the job. The fries are quite good, and come with your choice of two house-made sauces. I thought the horsey sauce was very good, but didn't care for the others.

If you're in the downtown STL area and looking for a good bite, I'd recommend this for most, but if you're looking for a larger burger you might want to look elsewhere. All in all the food was good, but seemed pricey for what we received.",2016-09-06 18:45:33

There was a crowd Saturday night, but no wait when we got there around 7:30. We were seated at the last 2-person table upstairs, directly overlooking the kitchen. So let's just say I got to watch a whole lot of chaos, including an order being returned, orders sitting way too long on the counter, and just general pandemonium.

I don't get the long communal table downstairs. All the different parties were seated with empty chairs between them, so isn't that just a huge waste of space? And if you do sit strangers right next to each other, who wants that? I definitely do not.

Service seemed to be hit or miss. Our waitress took forever to take our order and bring out the check, but our food came out pretty quickly. Conversely, the table right behind us came in 10 minutes after us, but they had their desserts and check way before us.

I really liked the smoked onions rings at first, but then the more I ate the less I liked. They have a thick, soft batter on them and the onions are thickly cut. We didn't get appetizer plates when they were brought out, yet the dipping sauce is served in a small jar that you can't fit an onion ring into unless you cut it up. I'm all for the cute little touches in this place (like the jars), but in this case it's not functional.

I also wasn't a fan of the two types of catsup I tried. The normal that comes with the burgers is really sweet. And I got the crazy catsup with my fries and liked that even less. Kudos for making their own sauces, but in this case I prefer Heinz.

However, the fries were really good. Salty and hot. I ordered the patty melt, which came on crustless rye instead of the homemade bun. By the time the food was delivered, the bread was soaked through with grease so I had to eat it with a fork. It tasted pretty good, but I couldn't differentiate between the MO grass-fed beef and beef at any other restaurant. It was a little crumbly, too. (I ordered no pink, though) The onions were too thickly sliced for my liking, but the Rooster sauce tasted good. The burgers come with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickle slices on the side. The 2 tiny pickle chips I got were so good, but they covered about half my burger. The same is true of the tiny tomato slices. Extra pickles cost extra. Bad.

They have the largest soda selection of any place I've ever been. Pretty much anything you could possibly want they have. I went with the cola on draft. Good stuff.

Since we were at the very last table, we were closest to the upstairs soda fountain and dirty dishes table (where the servers stack all the dirty dishes). It seemed like the wait staff was a little frazzled and I definitely overheard some complaints coming from them. The dirty dishes were stacked so high I thought they were going to fall over. Apparently no one was coming up to take them to the kitchen. Yet I saw one employee filling water bottles the entire time and another wiping glasses the entire time. I think they just need some better organization here.
 
For 2 burgers, 2 sodas, onion rings, and small fries our bill came to $30 + tip. Not too bad.",2011-10-31 18:46:00

I met a friend here for dinner. We both ordered the hamburger, fries, onion rings and the date salad. 

The burgers were nothing special. I was asked how i wanted it cooked and I said medium and it came out well done, I still ate it. It was kind of on the cold side and the bun was too chewy and not very fresh. The fries were ok, nothing special. My friend had the onion rings and I tasted one which was great. 

Since I was paying,  I thought over $50 bucks for a very mediocre simple dinner for 2 with the main course being hamburger was a bit stiff.

Also, and I'm being a bit of a snob, I know, but you'd think with all the floor to ceiling windows they would keep them clean. They were filthy! Everyone of them. And, while I'm at it, I also thought the seating was a bit uncomfortable. Who the hell wants to sit at a picnic table to eat inside?

It has a lot of positive qualities, but there's also plenty of negatives. I've been here twice with the beautiful wife, so it's time to write a review. Rather than writing some gripping story, let's just hit some points. I'll also say that this could have just as easily been a 4 star review. But for the price, I'll keep it at three.

The Good:
1) We've only been here in the evening for dinner, but service has been really good. We've also sat upstairs both times (more about that later). We also appreciated a visit by Gene Bailey (manager and brother of owner Dave), where we were able to give some feedback

2) The two burgers that I've had (PB&J (pesto, goat cheese, tomato jam on a bison patty) and the Ozark (Ozark mushrooms, caramelized onions, and goat cheese) have both been great. Lots of lots with a good amount of toppings

3) The flavor of the shakes -- we've had the Irish Coffee (delicious) and the Sweet Sweet Bacon (bourbon, candied bacon, salted
caramel ice cream). If you're a fan of Pulp Fiction, you'll remember Vincent commenting about the $5 milkshake. Do they put bourbon in this one? Oh yes they do. And is this a good milkshake? Nay, it's a a pretty fucking good milkshake

4) The beer list -- they're keeping it mostly local and there are some excellent beers on tap

5) The house made pickles and catsup, the fries, the smoked onion rings -- I enjoyed all of them

The ""not so good"":

1) Price -- especially if you enjoy alcoholic beverages, you can rack up some stupid bills. The two times we've been there we've ended up with hefty bills (with tip, over $90 each time). I guess if you're a ""let's split a burger, an order fries, and have one soda each"" type of couple, you'll be able to walk out of there for $20. But, you're not much fun either. So live with that.

2) The consistency of the shakes -- I'd put the Irish Coffee shake up there with anything that Kota or the Fountain offers, but at Bailey's Range, they're just too thin. I know that Kota bought some uber shake machine, and while I'm not buying one for them, at some point, they should upgrade

3) The cheese curds -- I like cheese curds, but admittedly, I expected fried cheese curds. Instead, these are fresh. So Wisconsinites, you've been warned.

4) The rest of the alcoholic drink menu -- just haven't been a fan of anything the beautiful wife has ordered. For instance, The Bermuda is pretty much a Dark & Stormy with passion fruit nectar. But as presented, all you tasted was the passion fruit. Other drinks tasted more fruity/light, but then again, when you've gotten used to drinking mixtologist concoctions all the time, it's probably my palate.

5) The Carolina burger (topped with smoked pork shoulder,
house bbq sauce, sweet & spicy slaw) was so drenched in BBQ sauce that you couldn't taste anything else. The sauce was wonderful, but if you really want this burger, get the sauce on the side so you can moderate the amount you put on.

I really want to love Bailey's Range -- but that doesn't mean that I hate it. More that I was hoping it would be a place where we'd go on a Tuesday night when we don't feel like cooking. Instead, it feels more like a ""we'll come here once a month.""",2011-10-31 00:42:39

Tonight the ice cream tasted like flavored water with sugar and had absolutely no taste to ice cream.  You could make better ice cream freezing milk mixed with some sugar. I felt dirty eating this ice cream and that usually only happens when I eat a triple cheeseburger with large fries at Mcd's.  

Usually the ice cream is too sweet but I don't complain since it has at least some taste. Now it seems like they are cheaping out on their quality/quantity to maximize profit.

It's great for bigger crowds, the food is fun, and the atmosphere of the restaurant does not leave you wanting. Bailey's doesn't quite get 5 stars because while the toppings on their burgers are fun, the meat tends to be a little dry, even as I order them cooked medium (maybe try medium-rare?!). If you're gonna be a burger place, your burger patty needs to be damn near perfect, in my opinion. I think the best things about Bailey's are their sauces: I would go just to get their fries and the rooster sauce. I'm not lying. I totally would. Their ice creams are OK, many of them are a little icy for my taste, and they don't carry any flavors that I haven't seen before.

Service: Attentive and quick. I was with a group of like 6 people and everything came out in due time.

Drinks: This is the first review where I've had to separate these two categories, but it deserves it! Bailey's Range has an intense drink menu- it's got your beers (This Bailey person really knows their beers!), yummy milkshake and alcoholic versions too AND awesome bottled drinks (See pictures for an old-time cola and the machine that holds the bottled drinks). I had some sort of alcoholic coffee based milkshake and it was deeeeeelish! Friends also enjoyed all of their drinks too.

Food: 
- Unfortunately, I was sick and not too hungry so I just went for a beef and barley soup which was really absolutely perfect. Warm and yummy, perfect for my sick and almost hungover self.
- My friends all got burgers and they smelled/looked and tasted delicious.
- We shared chili fries. Nothing special, just your typical ones.

Service was fast and friendly. The long tables encourage socializing with others but there are separate tables available for more intimate dining.

The burger was well presented, was topped with Pepperjack cheese, a bacon-wrapped jalapeno bomber and a chipotle sauce.

Overall, we had a good experience and I definitely like the concept of the place.

First a bit about the initial service which was uncalled for - Upon entering we noticed the almost empty communal table with no reserved signs. My dad, who has trouble walking, expressed interest in getting the end seats nearest to the entrance.  Personally I usually don't care where I'm seated but of course I have to look out for my dad.  

The two hostesses at the front were cold when I told them where we wanted to sit.  Not sure if this is due to inexperience or not being well directed, but they proceeded to take a few minutes to debate about putting us there. I tried to catch their attention and pointed out that my dad needed immediate seating.  They continue on a bit more before they asked a manager or whoever and he gave them the go ahead to seat us where we requested.  

Luckily we got a nice, efficient waiter.  I knew I wanted a bacon shake so I immediately ordered the Sweet Sweet Bacon. Unfortunately, they were out of bacon(!).  So I opted for a regular salted Carmel one which was decent enough. I probably should have added something else to it besides whipped cream.  My dad who usually favors Bud got a Revelation Stout and really enjoyed it.

Dad ordered the beef patty medium well with ketchup, white cheddar and grilled onions and I got the Chickpea Veggie.  We shared a large order of fries with sides of chipotle ketchup and cheese sauce.

Dad got the better end of the deal.  I tried a wedge of his burger and it was chargrilled, juicy and seasoned just right!  As much I enjoyed looking at all of the different specialty burgers on the menu, the patty didn't need much added to it. 

If done right, veggie burgers can be delicious. Unfortunately this one at Bailey's was on the bland side, and the cranberry compote didn't help matters.  The burger was dense yet dry, lacking texture and lukewarm in the middle.  I would recommend that the chef/cooks change the recipe to improve the texture, consistency and overall taste.  I'm sure they have ideas of how to turn that around.

Our order of fries was MASSIVE!  I'm more of a fan of the fresh cut variety (like the ones you get at Five Guys), but their seasoned ones are alright.  Their cheese sauce is delicious and their chipotle ketchup was good but lacked a smoky flavor.",2015-08-10 02:32:22

The main dining room downstairs is one long community table, but there are regular tables to the side and upstairs as well.

On the bartender's recommendation, I tried the PB&J Burger. No, there is no peanut butter involved (the peanut butter burger I had in Nebraska a few weeks prior was the first and last for me, but that's another story altogether!) The PB&J is actually a bison burger, with pesto, arugula, a sweet tomato jam and goat cheese. It's served with a side of ketchup (which I didn't think would work so well with the pesto) and a pickle. I also ordered a small side of fries with sriracha mayo.

The burger came out a bit smaller than expected, but the bison patty was plump and juicy, albeit a bit on the bland side - I guess I should've ordered a nice fatty beef burger instead of the leaner bison. The sweet tomato jam is also something I could've done without, but the deep flavor of the goat cheese evened things out. All in all, the burger tasted fine. The fries were fine as well. Nothing amazing, but exactly what you'd expect.

Baileys' Range does have a better-than-expected liquor selection and a long list of local microbrews on tap.

After eating, I decided to get to try the ice cream. Heavenly. They make their own ice cream on the premises. I got two HUGE scoops of salted caramel and peanut butter (Yes, peanut butter was destined to show up somehow). I think they use the same sweet cream base and just mix in flavors at the end because the two flavors I got were very similar. Still - rich, smooth, creamy and completely satisfying.

All in all, I'm glad I tried out Baileys' Range. The burger was fine (I'll get a beef burger next time) and the ice cream alone is worth coming in for.

I spent a while looking for it before I figured out I just didn't have what I was looking for!  I borrowed one from my husband but decided I wanted to go with something alcoholic instead.

I ordered the Buzzed burger (rubbed with espresso, topped with apples, diced onions and blue cheese)--medium, small fries with the wasabi ketchup, and the Bermuda cocktail.  My friend ordered onion rings to split between the three of us.

The onion rings were good. They had this smokiness to them that reminded me of cookouts over a campfire.

My burger seemed to be more medium-rare, but still amazing.  The flavors all worked amazingly well together.  I wasabi ketchup was good, but I ended up liking the rooster sauce my friend ordered even more.

There is a HUGE list of bottled sodas, really interesting ones. I didn't get one though, decided to stick with water. 

I ordered the veggie burger with fries and the regular ketchup, plus the creamy slaw. I asked if the slaw had onions because I don't like them and they make me sick. The waitress said she was pretty sure that it didn't but she'd check. Our food came out very quickly. The first thing I noticed was all the onions in the slaw. The second was that the veggie burger patty looked very different from any I've seen. The waitress told us it had beans, nuts, veggies... but it was pretty plain looking, no veggies apparent. I scraped the slaw off the burger and took a bite. The patty was mushy, room temp, and tasted like smashed beans with no seasoning and not even grilled. I tried the fries. They were good. The ketchup was ok - but from the bottle would've been fine. If you like a lot of sauce, this can get pricey. My sister and I each took another bite and just looked at each other. Gross. It was not at all good. In fact, it was pretty inedible. The waitress came by and we told her that we really didn't care for it, that it didn't taste like anything but mashed pinto beans and wasn't warm. She said she'd get the manager. We waited and waited and waited. And waited. No manager. Finally, our waitress came back and said they were taking the burgers off our bill. We were a little disappointed that the manager didn't come around. We really wanted to give our feedback about the burger and give advice on how to improve, as we want them to do well but vegetarians would NOT like this burger at all. 

I had some ice cream because I was pretty starving still, and it was decent. The mint tasted good but the chocolate chunks were huge and overwhelmed it. And the cookie dough was creamy and good but there wasn't very much cookie dough in it.

We walked out feeling disappointed. I hope that the owner/chef see this and take that veggie burger off the menu. It really brought the menu down. Rework it, try some other places, and give it some seasoning, veggies and cook it and I might try it again.",2011-10-29 20:53:34

My husband and I have been several times and we've found that this is a very accommodating place when it comes to finding seating for medium-to-large sized groups (6+ people). 

The Pros:
-The restaurant provides a wide variety of burger options that can be easily customized for those with special dietary needs (Consider the 6 available patty options).
-Ingredients are of great quality on their own, but the various condiments and mayos are to die for. Rooster mayo and sriracha catsup are always crowd favorites.
-The weekly burger battle ensures that there is always something new to try.
-The atmosphere somehow creates a location that is hip enough for 20-somethings wanting a night out while seamlessly also catering to multi-generational families. 
-As a fan of crafted cocktails and boozy milkshakes, I always find something that feels like a real treat.

The Cons:
-Noise can be a little bit bothersome when very busy given the restaurant's rather open floor plan. However, the noise does make it easier for people with little ones to enjoy a night out without worrying about any fusses causing a distraction.
-Small groups may be relegated to a community table to avoid waiting. This is not necessarily a bad thing since it speeds up seating, but can make conversation somewhat strained due to spillover from neighboring groups.",2015-05-02 00:17:09

Baileys' Range delivers with a plethora of options. Veggie lovers dont fret, there are options for you too.
We both selected bison with different toppings on a gluten free bun. Could've done without the gluten free bun as it was more the consistency of a biscuit and overpowered the flavors we were desiring. I had the Bison au Poivre and she had the PB&J, added bacon. We think the kitchen switched our meat. I ordered MED and she ordered MR, mine was MR and hers was MED. Toppings were delicious! We shared a side of fries with two creative ketchups: chipotle - nutty smokey and sweet, and the siracha - smokey spicy and robust. 

All washed down with a bottle of a California pinot noir, small winery...Vinum Cellars, 2010. Palatable and jammy at an affordable $ 28.

For real bang for your buck? The grilled cheese! IKR? Left fielder. But it's got three kinds of cheese and bacon, and it comes with excellent tomato soup! Even with my outstanding burger (with bacon jam!) I still lusted after my niece's meal instead.

The ice cream afterwards was a messy but delicious treat.

The view from the second floor to the rest of the joint is so cool, and the 90s R&B on the speakers  really made my day.

When I found out Bailey's opened another restaurant in STL, I needed to visit. Especially when I found out it was a burgers and shakes kind of place. I've already been to its sister restaurants: Chocolate Bar, the Bridge, & Rooster, so my expectations were high... and yes, as with all Bailey's establishments, Bailey's Range exceeded my expectations.

For a Saturday afternoon, there was plenty of seating. I love the rustic decor. The service was friendly. My fiance and I ordered the"" American"" to split. The description alone won us over: beef patty, fried mac 'n cheese patty, bacon, house sauce, and sriracha mayo. A perfect combination of flavors. Almost makes me wish I ordered my own instead of splitting... but the fries definitely made up for it. We ordered fries with the ""rooster"" sauce, which was a must!

For drinks, I ordered the Crown Valley Peachie Wit, which was FRUITY DELICIOUSNESS. I got the 9 oz, instead of the 16 oz, but then ended up ordering two 9 oz. Highly recommended. My fiance got the Sweet Sweet Bacon shake, which was a combination of maker's mark, candied bacon, salted caramel ice cream, but Sweet Sweet Bacon was NOT so sweet, it was TOO salty for our taste. The waitress was nice about it, so my fiance replaced it with an horchata shake (and I LOVE horchata)..so RumChata, vodka, and cinnamon ice cream made this 10x better.

My only thing that I thought was strange were the bathrooms. There were shared ""closet"" bathrooms and then it was a ""communal"" sink, but no big deal, they were clean.

Yes, Bailey's Range, I will be back.",2013-08-19 16:53:31

I'm a waitress so I understand kitchen is separate from serving. You nor I have no control over how the food taste but it surprised me to know they had zero authentic toppings for burgers, no reg ketchup, mustard, nor were the pickles just regular. It was extremely strange and I was not impressed w their whole made sauces. The waitress said we could get a free desert on the house since the burger was messed up but I had ordered a shake prior so I didn't understand if that was the case, she could've just taken that off ? $40 worth of food not worth it at all.

The burgers were delicious, and fried plentiful. While somewhat small in size, they made up for it with delicious beef, cooked exactly how I wanted it. And the buns were fantastic.
